# A Primer on the Mathematical Foundations of Deep Learning

These are basic notes for a lecture series I held on some mathematical foundations of deep learning.

At its core, Deep Learning is a profoundly mathematical field. Nevertheless, its application, invention, and recent progress are based primarily on intuition, analogies, and only some mathematics. While mathematicians and computer scientists work hard to produce good post hoc explanations, many questions remain open, and many attempts to answer them are disconnected from reality.

In these lectures, we give a mathematical introduction to Deep Learning and connect abstract concepts via exercises to hands-on implementations. We will present mathematical explanations wherever we can but avoid them where they suggest a rigor that does not exist.

Thankfully we are now at a point where mathematics plays a more prominent role in Deep Learning. However, it is also clear that much of the progress still resembles [alchemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7psGHgatGM) -- dressing our alchemy up as chemistry does not seem wise when it is still alchemy.
